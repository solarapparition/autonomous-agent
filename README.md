# Autonomous Mind

## Reminders:
- The end user is NOT other people but the Mind itself.
- Keep the code here as direct as possibleâ€”this will be read by the Mind and we don't to avoid going through layers of abstraction to understand what's happening.
- Full state of current run should be serialized and easily readable.
  - dynamic environments such as browser and Jupyter should be persistent on a cloud server.
  - if something happens to them, event must be sent to the Mind.
